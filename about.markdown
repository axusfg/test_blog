I am currently a sophomore at Northwestern University studying Computer Science. 

For the past few years, I have created and maintained Note to Scale because I am fascinated by the multidimensional nature of business. So many events in today's world require different lenses to truly understand their root causes and implications.

The essays on my blog are my ongoing attempt to do just that — utilize my academic interests to explain the world's most challenging, yet exciting business problems.
